# Atlas Journal Starter

## Quickstart
1. Run the setup script for your platform:
   - macOS/Linux: `./setup.sh`
   - Windows PowerShell: `./setup.ps1`
2. Activate the newly created virtual environment (the scripts will do this for you if run in a new shell).
3. Launch the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_hello.py
   ```

## Why Atlas Journal?
Atlas Journal is designed to make it simple to explore data-backed storytelling with Streamlit and Plotly. This starter gives you a friendly foundation for building interactive notebooks that feel like beautiful apps right out of the gate.

## What's Next
- Scaffold additional pages to map out the journal experience.
- Connect to your preferred data source and load example datasets.
- Add authentication and user personalization when you're ready for collaboration.
